Hi there!

This is a personal site built with:
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- SwiperJS for slides ( https://swiperjs.com/ )
- EmailJS for emails
- pure hardcodre CSS3
- even more hardcode CSS animations
- MUI icons 

By the end of the development the site will probably be up and running on a domain bought on hostinger.com ( https://www.hostinger.co.il/web-hosting?irclickid=w1aTH4StjxyNWhnSQJRNWxz7UkFz8kQ1lwyM3A0&irgwc=1&PID=3863035 );

Each component and each line has a detailed comment, so feel free to use it as a template and/or for learning purposes; for any recommendations and comments - send me a direct message!
